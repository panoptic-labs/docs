## Market Overview

  

October was one of the most exciting opportunities for trading in quite some time. We saw gamma perform, volatility increase, and directional moves take place. [The primary catalyst of most of these outsized movements was related to a spot ETF](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/10/29/why-is-bitcoins-price-surging/?sh=45b43c675368).

  

On October 16, we saw our first sign of higher prices as [CoinTelegraph tweeted out news about an early approval of the Blackrock Spot ETF](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1713925876969017792). This news was quickly found to be false, and the breakout move higher toward $30K quickly reversed to a low of $27.9K.

  

One week later, on October 23, another move catalyzed by ETF-related news took place as Twitter users quickly discovered that a ticker for the Blackrock spot ETF was published on the DTCC website. [Ironically, this fact had been true since August](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/25/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-has-since-august-been-on-dtcc-site-that-moved-markets-this-week/), but the move in price had already happened and saw no signs of reversing.

### Notable Days in October

  

The two most noticeable days in October were the two breakouts on October 16 and a week later on October 23rd. Both of these, as stated previously, were catalyzed primarily by tweets and the subsequent demand. Both volatility and gamma started to perform, and we broke out to [new local highs not seen for over a year and a half.](https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-soars-to-one-and-a-half-year-high-on-etf-bets-11698110805073.html#:~:text=Bitcoin%2C%20the%20world's%20largest%20cryptocurency,exchange%2Dtraded%20fund%20(ETF)&text=Bitcoin%20has%20soared%2011.86%20percent,%2434%2C322.47%2C%20as%20per%20CoinMarketCap%20data.)

  
  

### Market Indicators

  

Skew on these recent moves has driven sharply toward calls for all listed expiries. With implied volatility historically elevated compared to previous months, call spreads are attractive. To take advantage of the current spot/vol correlation, risk reversals (sell a put and buy a call) are also becoming attractive.

Implied volatility across the board over the past few days has declined compared to the highs made on the breakout move. We see weekly ATM‚Äôs down around 6 points, with longer-dated expiries picking up interest. Call open interest is massively up, as [Paradigm saw new all-time highs in trading volume.](https://x.com/tradeparadigm/status/1716647468471881838?s=20)

### Current Market Conditions

  

As of the end of October, BTC was trading around $34,440 (now $34,495), and ETH was around $1,808 (now $1,805). The market was primarily focused on ETF-centric catalysts, and speculation on other factors, such as [dealer gamma positioning, started to take place on Twitter.](https://x.com/CryptoDeFiGuy/status/1719002326315180096?s=20) We have not traded at these levels for over a year and a half, so new levels of support and resistance should be expected to form here. Liquidations, spot demand, and other potential catalysts will be primary drivers of price from here on.
