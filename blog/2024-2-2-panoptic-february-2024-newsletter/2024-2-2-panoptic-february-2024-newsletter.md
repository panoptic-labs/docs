## Panoptic Highlights

### Epoch 4 Highlights

#### Top Trade in Epoch 4

In the recent trading epoch, savvy traders capitalized on the bearish market mood triggered by the post-ETF announcement sell-off. By strategically employing puts and straddles, they not only navigated through the downturn but also accrued [streamia](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/streamia-defi-native-options-pricing), enhancing their profits.

The epoch's [top trader](https://beta4.panoptic.xyz/positions/0x14fc548c302fae3f424a0a47706?view_as=0x376f59d57c4db76e0da71e9952898cce419d05fc&block_number=40786727) achieved an impressive 81.49% profit by astutely timing the market‚Äîentering a put option position when AVAX was around $35.90 and exiting as the price dipped to $30 a week later. Despite the successful trade, the trader incurred $7.04 in streamia, a small price for the substantial returns garnered during this volatile period.

### Shallow Dive ‚Äî Leverage on Panoptic

‚Äã‚ÄãLeverage on Panoptic opens up [powerful opportunities](https://panoptic.xyz/research/panoptic-leverage) for traders, enabling them to control a greater value of assets than the collateral they provide. By depositing a fraction of the asset's value, traders can engage in options trading with up to 10x leverage when buying options, and up to 5x when selling, depending on market liquidity. This system, supported by passive liquidity providers (PLPs), ensures a stable and efficient trading environment where advanced strategies can be employed for even higher capital efficiency, all with the added security of collateral backing each position.

  

## Market Overview

### BTC ETF

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recently marked a significant milestone, surpassing $2 billion in assets under management, a feat that highlights the growing investor interest in crypto-based ETFs. Following this achievement, attention is now turning towards the potential launch of an Ethereum ETF, with approval deadlines as early as May. This is around the same time as the anticipated Bitcoin halving event, which historically has impacted market dynamics.

  

## Option & Defi Trends

Following the announcement of the Bitcoin ETF, derivative volatility (DVOL) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a notable downturn, with spot prices echoing this decline. Open interest (OI) for Bitcoin fell below $8 billion, marking its first such dip in over six months, while Ethereum's OI demonstrated stability, maintaining around $7.5 billion with minimal impact from the ETF news, highlighting the market looking towards a potential ETH Spot ETF arrival in May.

  

#### Lyra is growing exponentially

The DeFi options market is experiencing substantial growth, as evidenced by the 327% Month-over-Month increase in notional volume within the [Lyra protocol](https://defillama.com/options/lyra). Lyra‚Äôs rapid growth is largely due to ETH options and perpetual futures launching on their new product, Lyra V2. The rise in volume within protocols like Lyra indicates a heightened demand for advanced financial instruments in the decentralized space.

  

#### Bitcoin Steadies Amid U.S. Economic Growth Surge

Bitcoin maintained stability as the U.S. economy reported a stronger than expected 3.3% GDP growth in Q4, surpassing estimates and signaling a near match to the December inflation rate. Despite a slowdown from Q3's 4.9% growth, robust consumer and government spending fueled the economy. Amidst this, Bitcoin oscillated around the $40,000 mark with significant trading volumes, while the crypto market braces for the expiration of billions in BTC and ETH options, hinting at an active rollover of positions and an eventful end to a tumultuous month marked by the launch of multiple Bitcoin ETFs and notable shifts in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.
