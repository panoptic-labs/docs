Following the launch of UNI [incentives](/blog/uni-token-incentives-on-panoptic) on Unichain and the success of our trading competitions, we're excited to announce the next contest, centered around **ETH**.

The ETH market is a playground for trying out LP strategies, options trading, hedging, and other volatility plays using Panoptic’s perpetual options.

Anyone can join—just trade in the designated **ETH/USDC 0.05% v4 market on Unichain** to participate. Prizes are available for the best trader, the worst trade, the most traded, and more! Prizes include 2,250,000 Pips, $2,000 USDC, and a consolation prize!

**Minimum deposit: $100**.
You’re welcome to deposit more than the minimum required. Keep in mind that a higher deposit requires a higher percentage return to rank competitively.

Please **do not withdraw any collateral from the ETH market** during the competition period or your profit and loss (PnL) % will be negatively impacted. PnL % is evaluated based on the **maximum, cumulative amount of funds you had deposited** during the event. This ensures fair comparison across all participants.
