# What is Panoptic Prime?

Panoptic Prime is our new loyalty program for the people who get it. It’s for the traders and LPs who’ve been putting in the work, who know their way around Panoptic, and who want to be part of what’s coming next.

It’s a **private, invite-only** corner of our Discord — a space where you’ll get early access, real alpha, private competitions, and a direct line to the core team. You'll be first in line to test new features, share feedback, and help shape the future of Panoptic alongside other serious users.

You don’t need to be an expert. You just need to care enough to be here.

## Who’s getting in?

To become a Prime Member, you need to meet at least one of the following:

- 100,000+ Base Pips

    or    
- Hold a Panoptic testnet [NFT or POAP](https://poap.family/events/151512,156764,156765,159354,159355,165545,165546,167273,167274,167935,167936,169080,169081)
    

Verification’s simple — just fill out a short form with your wallet and Discord ID. We’ll handle the rest.
