This [trader](https://app.panoptic.xyz/trade/Ethereum/?tokenId=0x5002fb20203003c8ad599c3a0ff) sold naked calls on ETH at the $3,280 strike‚Äîan unhedged short call position covering approximately 20.27 WETH (notional value of about $66.5K). By selling during a market sell-off, when tariff concerns drove volatility higher, they collected a larger-than-normal [streamia](//docs/product/streamia) of about $3,402.

![](./02.png)
Because implied volatility was elevated, the option contracts were priced richly, and the trader effectively capitalized on the heightened fear in the market.

![](./03.png)
They skillfully closed the calls before ETH bounced, locking in a total profit of approximately $6,379 (nearly 9.59% of notional) while still near-the-money. The margin requirement was around $14,431, and by exiting early, they sidestepped the risk of a surge above $3,280 that could have eroded or wiped out their gains. As a result, the trader earned a significant amount of streamia and navigated the position intelligently, profiting from time decay and implied volatility convergence without facing a large adverse price move.

### Panoptic‚Äôs Ethereum Debut: Ushering in a New Era for DeFi Options

On December 18, 2024, Panoptic officially [launched](//blog/panoptic-launch) on Ethereum, introducing perpetual options as a groundbreaking DeFi derivative. By leveraging Uniswap‚Äôs automated market maker (AMM) model, Panoptic eliminates impermanent loss for passive LPs while providing higher earnings and better risk management for active LPs. Fully onchain and permissionless, Panoptic‚Äôs integration marks a significant milestone for DeFi, reshaping how traders and LPs participate in on-chain markets.

As Guillaume Lambert, Panoptic‚Äôs founder, remarked, this innovation parallels the impact of perpetual futures, positioning Panoptic as ‚Äúthe Uniswap of options.‚Äù Supported by Uniswap Labs Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and other industry leaders, Panoptic enables seamless options creation on any digital asset in Uniswap‚Äôs ecosystem. This launch marks a pivotal step in reshaping DeFi, offering traders and LPs unprecedented tools to maximize profitability while mitigating risk.

### Breaking the Uniswap Doom Loop: How Panoptic Empowers Market Stability

The Uniswap price [doom loop](//research/derivatives-solve-uniswap-doom-loop) presents a systemic challenge for LPs, exacerbating downward price spirals due to the inherent rebalancing mechanics of automated market makers (AMMs). When prices stray out of range, LPs must rebalance by selling tokens, triggering negative feedback cycles that amplify price declines. This issue is further intensified if LPs hedge their positions, creating additional sell pressure akin to a perpetual short put option dynamic.

![](./05.png)

Panoptic directly addresses this imbalance by introducing a complete derivatives ecosystem to Uniswap. By enabling the shorting of LP tokens and other advanced strategies, Panoptic allows traders to offset doom loop risks, providing balance and mitigating volatility. Derivatives like Panoptic‚Äôs perpetual options have historically demonstrated their ability to stabilize spot markets, as evidenced in traditional markets where futures and options trading reduced price volatility and enhanced liquidity. For the first time, Uniswap LPs gain access to tools that not only protect but also potentially profit from turbulent market conditions, transforming the doom loop into a ‚Äúboom loop.‚Äù

### Guillaume Lambert Walks Through Panoptic's First Liquidation Event

Panoptic reached a milestone with its first liquidation, signaling the strength of its DeFi options mechanics. Our founder, Guillaume Lambert, explained the details: the liquidated account leveraged ETH calls but fell below the collateral requirement due to adverse price movements. This case also introduced a fascinating "negative bonus," where the liquidator provided USDC to receive a net-positive bonus in WETH.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important milestone for Panoptic: the first liquidation happened last night. This liquidation is particularly noteworthy because it led to a negative bonus (?!)<br/><br/>Here&#39;s the breakdown of what happened üëá<br/><br/>The liquidated account deposited $300 worth of ETH in the ETH-USDC-30bps‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/Fd9FtFQzeu">pic.twitter.com/Fd9FtFQzeu</a></p>&mdash; GEE-yohm LAMB-bear (@guil_lambert) <a href="https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1877012736418201668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
