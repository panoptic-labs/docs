## Best Naughty Trader
[Milady](https://opensea.io/collection/milady) 2447 goes to the best naughty trader: 0x955916640f96efcd66f4aee595e0a44700a57868!

0x9559 rapidly [opened and exercised](https://deeznuts.panoptic.xyz/?view_as=0x955916640f96efcd66f4aee595e0a44700a57868) many long options for quick profits while manipulating the Uniswap price with their alt account. They hid their profits by withdrawing, and then proceeded to re-deposit them right before the last day.

The actual competition end time was around 12 hours later. To keep the competition fair, the end time was kept secret with the hash posted on our [blog](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/december-nutcracker). The hash can be verified using [this](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html?input_type=utf-8&input=Thursday%2C%20February%2022%2C%2011%3A38%20am%20EST%20Salt%3AWzzPwF(_yEg*K4Jvx4D%3BU%5DW!J%3DLX%40T&hmac_input_type=utf-8)) preimage.
