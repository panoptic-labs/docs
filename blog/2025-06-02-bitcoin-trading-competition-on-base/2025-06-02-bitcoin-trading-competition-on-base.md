Following the strong momentum from our recent [launch on Base](/blog/panoptic-launches-on-base) and the success of our [trading competition](/blog/base-trading-competition-concludes), we're excited to announce the next contest, centered around [cbBTC](https://app.panoptic.xyz/markets/base/0x128f822727193887ffc4186b556f2d68e60dc330).

With Bitcoin recently hitting a new all-time high, the cbBTC market unlocks new possibilities for directional strategies, volatility plays, and capital-efficient positioning using Panoptic’s perpetual options.

Anyone can join—just trade in the designated cbBTC/USDC 30bps v4 market on Base to participate. The best PnL and volume will be rewarded, but there is more than one prize to win. Prizes include 5.45M Pips, $4.8K USDC, and a Michael Saylor pillow!

  

> **Minimum deposit: $100**

You’re welcome to deposit more than the minimum required. Keep in mind that a higher deposit requires a higher percentage return to rank competitively.
  

Please **do not withdraw collateral from the cbBTC market** during the competition period or your PnL will be negatively impacted. PnL % is evaluated based on the **maximum cumulative deposits** you made during the event. This ensures fair comparison across all participants.

> _Note: Unlike the previous competition, PnL will now be based only on your placed trades and Passive LP earnings. Changes in collateral value due to asset price movements will no longer impact your PnL._
