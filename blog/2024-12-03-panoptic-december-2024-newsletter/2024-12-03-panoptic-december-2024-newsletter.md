## Panoptic Highlights

### Uniswap vs. Deribit: Unpacking the Volatility Connection

The relationship between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX) is evolving, and implied volatility (IV) metrics provide a critical lens for understanding these dynamics. [Comparing IV](https://panoptic.xyz/research/comparing-uniswap-deribit-implied-volatilities) on Uniswap and Deribit reveals intriguing patterns: while both exhibit correlated trends, Uniswap‚Äôs IV is consistently lower, averaging 55%‚Äîmore than 10 percentage points below Deribit. This difference stems from Uniswap‚Äôs ‚Äúsell-only‚Äù options market, where liquidity providers (LPs) act as option sellers without the ability to buy, suppressing IV. Excess liquidity in key pools like ETH/USDC further compounds the issue, reducing option premiums and impacting LP profitability.

Panoptic aims to reshape this landscape by enabling users to borrow LP positions and remove them from Uniswap, effectively allowing the purchase of options. This mechanism increases demand for options, raising Uniswap‚Äôs IV and aligning it closer to Deribit‚Äôs levels. By unlocking new strategies, Panoptic introduces a more balanced and profitable dynamic for LPs, reducing oversupply and enhancing returns. For further insights, check out the thread below.

### Shallow Dive: Panoptic Turns Impermanent Loss into Permanent Opportunity

Impermanent Loss (IL) has been a persistent challenge for liquidity providers (LPs) in decentralized finance (DeFi), as token price volatility in liquidity pools often leads to diminished returns. Panoptic‚Äôs [innovative solutions](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/turning-impermanent-loss-into-gain) tackle this issue head-on, providing LPs with tools to hedge against IL, earn additional revenue, or even profit from market movements. LPs can lend their LP tokens to generate extra income, utilize single-sided liquidity for risk-free participation, or employ shorting strategies to turn potential losses into gains. These mechanisms not only reduce risk but also open new avenues for LPs to maximize profitability.

A standout feature of Panoptic is its shorting of LP tokens, which mimics the effect of buying a put option. This approach allows traders to benefit from downward price movements and mitigate the traditional drawbacks of IL. Additionally, passive LPing lets users focus on single-sided liquidity, simplifying participation for those who prefer a hands-off strategy. By combining advanced financial tools with a user-friendly interface, Panoptic is redefining liquidity provisioning in DeFi and fostering a more inclusive and robust market environment.

## Market Overview

### BTC Options Market Signals Bullish Sentiment, Eyes Year-End Volatility

The BTC [options](https://x.com/GreeksLive/status/1862381339955339405) market showed a strong concentration around the November 29 and December 27 expirations, comprising over 61% of the total open interest. The put-call ratio of 0.58 highlights a bullish bias, with calls significantly outpacing puts. This optimism aligns with broader market sentiment, but the December 27 expiration‚Äìwhich accounts for nearly 36% of open interest‚Äìunderscores the potential for heightened volatility. As institutions position cautiously, memories of the turbulent 2020 year-end loom large, suggesting that while the market mood remains upbeat, the risk of sharp movements cannot be ignored.

Together, the two platforms are redefining how users interact with decentralized investment opportunities.

#### Guillaume Lambert Unveils Panoptic‚Äôs Vision for Perpetual Options

Our founder, Guillaume Lambert, expanded on Panoptic's groundbreaking approach to decentralized liquidity. He detailed how LP positions on Uniswap act as perpetual options and how Panoptic allows users to borrow and short these tokens for speculation or hedging without counterparty risk.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2. Panoptic also lets you borrow+short LP tokens. Borrowing an LP token is effectively *buying* a perpetual option.<br/><br/>Buying options with no counterparty risk is good for hedging &amp; risk management.<br/><br/>Or it can be used for pure speculation. Think perps, but with no liquidation risk <a href="https://t.co/RVl9Um8IKx">pic.twitter.com/RVl9Um8IKx</a></p>&mdash; GEE-yohm LAMB-bear (@guil_lambert) <a href="https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1838609506546389042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

By tying option premiums to realized volatility, Panoptic ensures accurate pricing and [higher yields](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/uniswap-lps-unlock-3x-more-fees-with-panoptic) compared to traditional Uniswap LPing. Guillaume also highlighted the platform‚Äôs use of ERC-1155 tokens, which optimize gas efficiency while making options composable across DeFi.
