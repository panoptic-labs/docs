We're kicking off an exclusive, limited-time trading competition to celebrate our launch on Base—rack up points, win cash rewards, and compete for epic prizes! Whether you're an options expert, LP, or just getting started, this is your moment to get rewarded for trading.


Anyone can join—just trade in the designated [ETH/USDC 5bps v4 market on Base](https://app.panoptic.xyz/markets/base/0x36a3088b94f73853a3964a0352b47605c6354f27) to participate. The highest PnL and volume will be awarded, but there is more than one prize to win.

### Minimum deposit: $100
You’re welcome to deposit more than the minimum required. Just keep in mind that a higher deposit means you'll need a higher percentage return to rank competitively.


  

If you withdraw any collateral during the competition, your performance will still be evaluated based on the maximum, cumulative amount of funds you had deposited during the event. This ensures fair comparison across all participants.
