_Panoptic is thrilled to announce our selection as a grant recipient by the [Uniswap Foundation](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org/). This grant will go toward a platform to ‘grow’ your portfolio by providing passive liquidity on Uniswap v4, the [upcoming iteration](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1758146187318669666) of the Uniswap Protocol._

## The gRHO Platform

![](./01.png)

The gRHO platform (pronounced "grow") is an open-source, forkable interface for passive liquidity providers (LPs) and token launchers on Uniswap v4. The name "gRHO" reflects its purpose of providing LPs with an opportunity to earn interest, as "rho" is the options Greek related to interest rates.

The platform will simplify LPing for everyone, allowing users to earn yield passively. It will also aid token launchers in creating pools, bootstrapping markets, and managing liquidity for their token.

>_"We are thrilled to support Panoptic in their mission to revolutionize liquidity provisioning on Uniswap with the ‘gRHO’ platform,"_ says Aaron Lamphere, Grants Lead at the Uniswap Foundation.
>  
>_"This grant represents our commitment to fostering innovation and simplifying the user experience for liquidity providers. By enabling passive liquidity provision, Panoptic’s open-source gRHO platform will open new doors for LPs, making DeFi more accessible and rewarding for everyone involved."_

## Bringing Passive LP to Uniswap

The gRHO platform will bring passive LPing to Uniswap. This is an easier way to LP than on Uniswap v2 and v3 with no impermanent loss.

LPs on Uniswap v3 must actively create and manage their LP position. The amount of choices and monitoring that is required to earn yield and avoid losses is overwhelming for many LPs. For example, active LPs on Uniswap v3 must deposit the correct ratio of two tokens, choose a price range, monitor their position to ensure it stays in range, and rebalance when going out of range if they want to earn yield. When faced with so many choices and upkeep, LPs are discouraged from contributing their liquidity.

Passive LPs will be able to earn without the hassles faced by active LPs. Passive LPing is easy: users deposit single-sidedly without having to select a price range, rebalance their positions, or suffer impermanent loss. Passive LPs will no longer have to deal with the intricacies of how to successfully deploy liquidity. Passive liquidity is made available for active LPs to borrow and create positions in Uniswap v4, for which passive LPs are compensated.

It may never be possible to satisfy both active and passive LPs. Each one is a very clear use case of automated market makers (AMMs) and requires distinct ways of participation. The gRHO platform will bring passive liquidity back to Uniswap v4.
