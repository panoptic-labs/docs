Panoptic, a DeFi-native options trading platform, launched today on Ethereum, introducing a new DeFi derivative: the perpetual option.

Perpetual options give investors the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified price at any time, unlike traditional options with fixed expiry dates. Perpetual options are powered by Panoptic's innovative pricing model, [streamia](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/streamia-defi-native-options-pricing), to reduce fees, increase accessibility, and offer 24/7 market access.

>_"Perpetual options are the most innovative financial primitive since perps," said Guillaume Lambert, founder and CEO of Panoptic. "DeFi's biggest strength is that it is permissionless, and Panoptic leverages this openness to effectively create the Uniswap of options, allowing anyone to trade options on any asset."_

Panoptic is backed by Uniswap Labs Ventures and other industry leaders, including Greenfield Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Jane Street, and gumi Cryptos Capital (gCC).

>_"Panoptic represents the future of DeFi by empowering liquidity providers and traders with tools to enhance profitability and reduce risk in ways that were previously unattainable," said Evan Mair, Principal at gCC. "We see it as a pivotal step in evolving DeFi markets and are proud to support a team at the forefront of this innovation."_

Panoptic integrates with Uniswap v3 and v4, offering perpetual options on all assets available on one of the world's largest decentralized exchanges.

Panoptic's Ethereum launch opens the platform to the public, unlocking new opportunities for LPs and traders to create calls, puts, perps, and advanced risk hedging positions on any digital asset on Uniswap. Users can start trading on the [platform](http://app.panoptic.xyz) today.

### About Panoptic

Panoptic offers a market-driven solution to boost LP profitability, a safe way to avoid impermanent loss (IL), and an intuitive interface for perps, options, and institutional investors.

Built on Uniswap, Panoptic LPs earn the same yield as in Uniswap pools, with the potential to earn extra yield from the [spread](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/product/spread) when their tokens are leveraged in a trade. Uniswap LPs can access this extra yield by [deploying their tokens on Panoptic](http://app.panoptic.xyz).  
  
Panoptic addresses IL by offering several strategies: LPs can reduce IL with extra yield from lending out LP tokens, avoid it through [passive, single-sided liquidity](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/bringing-passive-liquidity-to-uniswap), or profit from it by shorting an LP position. Shorting LP tokens, a key feature of Panoptic, is the inverse trade of LPing.

Panoptic's intuitive interface replaces traditional order books with a visual approach, letting users easily build strategies based on whether they believe an asset will rise or fall. Advanced traders can access one-click strategies, including multi-leg options and perp trading. Traders can also create their own options markets using any tokens available on Uniswap.

The platform has undergone comprehensive [third-party security audits](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/security/security_audits) to ensure integrity and reliability. Panoptic is rolling out a public [bug bounty program](/docs/security/bug-bounties) in partnership with [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/welcome).

To drive participation and bootstrap liquidity, the company launched the [Panoptic Incentive Points Program](https://pips.panoptic.xyz/), designed to engage traders of all experience levels and reward them for their contributions.

Panoptic will expand to other layer 2 (L2) and EVM-compatible chains in a phased rollout. Future developments include the launch of its Uniswap v4 Liquidity Interface, the [gRHO platform](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-awarded-uniswap-foundation-grant).
