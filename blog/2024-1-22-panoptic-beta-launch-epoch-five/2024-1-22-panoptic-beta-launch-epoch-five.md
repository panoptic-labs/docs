![](./epoch-5-opens-banner.png)

Mark your calendars! On Thursday, January 25, we will be transitioning from Panoptic's Epoch 4 trading competition to the exciting launch of Epoch 5. Epoch 5 will see the DeFi options protocol launch on a new chain, expand the available markets to trade on, and $1000 in prizes up for grabs.


Just like Epoch 4, Epoch 5 is **open to everyone**. Whether you're a seasoned trader or new to the platform, this is your chance to dive in! Additionally, the first 100 depositors will be eligible to claim the Epoch 5 POAP, celebrating their early involvement in this new phase.
 

## About Our Beta Launch

Panoptic's [beta launch](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-sign-up) is structured as multiple rounds of trading competitions called epochs. In the epochs, participants use real, albeit capped, assets to buy and sell perpetual options.


In each round of the trading competition, top performers receive prizes. Throughout the beta launch, we’re offering exclusive NFTs and up to $100,000 in monetary prizes.


## Epoch 5 Overview  

For the fifth epoch, we're moving to a new chain and bringing new options markets to the competition.
  

### Panoptic Launches on Optimism

Epoch 5 sees Panoptic's beta options protocol launch on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), a fast and stable Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain.

### Panoptic Launches Threshold BTC (tBTC) Market

Panoptic is partnering with [Threshold](https://threshold.network/), a decentralized threshold cryptography network that connects Bitcoin to DeFi with tBTC, to introduce Bitcoin options on [Base](https://base.org/).

### New Markets

Epoch 5 introduces new options markets to DeFi. Participants now have the opportunity to trade perpetual options on the Optimism (OP) and tBTC tokens.

### Participation
    Whitelist: No whitelist, anyone can participate
    Eligibility: Verification via X (formerly Twitter)

tBTC-USDbC 0.05%:

    1st Place: $500 USDC
    2nd Place: $300 USDC

### Collateral Requirements

  
|      Pool Parameter     |       Value       |                                                             Example                                                            |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Sell Collateral Ratio   | 20% (5x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH short put position would require at least 0.2 ETH in collateral.                                          |
| Buy Collateral Ratio    | 10% (10x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH long put position would require at least 0.1 ETH in collateral.                                           |
| Mint Buffer Requirement | 1.1x             | Suppose the buy collateral ratio is 10%. Buying a 1 ETH put would require at least 0.11 ETH in collateral (0.11 = 1.1 x 10%). |

  

### Pool Utilization (PU)

|       Pool Parameter       | Value |                                                                                Example                                                                               |
|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Target Pool Utilization    | 50%   | Half of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to target this amount.                    |
| Saturated Pool Utilization | 75%   | Three-quarters of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to avoid exceeding this amount. |  


## Disclaimer

During Panoptic’s beta launch, the protocol is still in an experimental state, and trading activities involve inherent risks. Engaging in the competition may lead to a loss of funds due to the inherent nature of trading assets and the experimental nature of the protocol. Participants are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct their due diligence before making any financial decisions.
