![](./epoch-4-opens-banner.png)

Next Wednesday, January 10, Panoptic is rolling out Epoch 4 with some changes that will spice up our trading competition. Most notably, we're launching on a new chain, expanding the available markets to trade on, and giving out more prizes.


In the past we've limited our Epochs to a select list of individuals, but this time we're expanding access: **anyone will be able to join the trading competition**. Additionally, the first 100 depositors will be eligible to claim the Epoch 4 POAP.
 

## About Our Beta Launch

Panoptic's [beta launch](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-sign-up) is structured as multiple rounds of trading competitions called epochs. In the epochs, participants use real, albeit capped, assets to buy and sell perpetual options.


In each round of the trading competition, top performers receive prizes. Throughout the beta launch, we’re offering exclusive NFTs and up to $100,000 in monetary prizes.


## Epoch 4 Overview  

For the fourth epoch, we're moving to a new chain and bringing new options markets to the competition.
  

### Panoptic's AvaLAUNCH

Epoch 4 sees Panoptic's beta options protocol launch on [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), a decentralized and open-source proof of stake blockchain.

### New Markets

Epoch 4 introduces new options markets to DeFi. Participants now have the opportunity to trade perpetual options in two new markets:

1. Avax options
2. [Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/avalanche) options

Each market offers rewards for top traders, with a total prize pool of $1,000.

In addition to the monetary prizes, exclusive NFTs will be awarded to the top five traders of each market.  

### Participation
    Whitelist: No whitelist, anyone can participate
    Eligibility: Verification via X (formerly Twitter)

### Timeline
    Start Date: January 10, 17:00 UTC
    End Date: January 24, 17:00 UTC

WAVAX-USDC 0.05%:

JOE-WAVAX 0.3%:

    1st Place: $200 USDC

For Epoch 4, the first 100 participants will receive an Epoch 4 POAP that is custom designed by the Panoptic team. The top five traders of each market will be eligible for a Top Trader POAP.
  
The ranking metrics are based on profit and loss (PnL) calculated in terms of the account's value at the end of the epoch.

As part of our multi-epoch beta launch, we will be testing various combinations of these pool parameter values to assess their safety, robustness, and fairness for a variety of tokens and market conditions.

  

We outline the pool parameter values for Epoch 4 below. For further explanation of how these parameters affect users in Panoptic, please see our pool parameters [guide](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-parameters).

### Collateral Requirements

  
|      Pool Parameter     |       Value       |                                                             Example                                                            |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Sell Collateral Ratio   | 20% (5x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH short put position would require at least 0.2 ETH in collateral.                                          |
| Buy Collateral Ratio    | 10% (10x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH long put position would require at least 0.1 ETH in collateral.                                           |
| Mint Buffer Requirement | 1.1x             | Suppose the buy collateral ratio is 10%. Buying a 1 ETH put would require at least 0.11 ETH in collateral (0.11 = 1.1 x 10%). |

  

### Pool Utilization (PU)

|       Pool Parameter       | Value |                                                                                Example                                                                               |
|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Target Pool Utilization    | 50%   | Half of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to target this amount.                    |
| Saturated Pool Utilization | 75%   | Three-quarters of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to avoid exceeding this amount. |  


## Disclaimer

During Panoptic’s beta launch, the protocol is still in an experimental state, and trading activities involve inherent risks. Engaging in the competition may lead to a loss of funds due to the inherent nature of trading assets and the experimental nature of the protocol. Participants are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct their due diligence before making any financial decisions.
