Panoptic Launches on Base

We are excited to announce that [Panoptic](https://app.panoptic.xyz/), the DeFi-native perpetual options platform built on Uniswap, has officially launched on Base! To celebrate, we’re kicking off a two‑week trading competition on Base—with $5,000 in cash prizes, over 5 million Pips, and a jumbo Rilakkuma plushie—open to all traders.


This launch unlocks a new frontier for degens, strategists, and onchain power users. Base’s low fees and fast finality make it the perfect playground for trading—and now with Panoptic, you can take those plays even further. Go beyond simple swaps and LPing: build perpetual, gas-efficient options strategies directly onchain. Whether you're hedging, farming, or looking for asymmetric upside, Panoptic on Base is your new power tool.


> _The Panoptic [app](https://app.panoptic.xyz/) is only available to non-US users, while [gRHO](https://grho.panoptic.xyz/) is available globally._

The Base ecosystem is growing fast—and Panoptic brings the tools to stay ahead of the meta.

# Base: Bringing the World Onchain

Base is designed to be a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum Layer 2 solution aimed at bringing the next billion users onchain. With its architecture, Base offers significantly reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet, facilitating seamless and efficient onchain experiences. ​

  

> _"Integrating with Base marks a significant milestone for Panoptic,"_ said Guillaume Lambert, CEO & Founder of Panoptic. _"By launching on Base, we can offer LPs and options traders a faster and more cost-effective experience, aligning with our mission to make options trading more accessible and efficient."_

# About Panoptic

Panoptic is an onchain liquidity and perpetual options platform built on top of Uniswap v3 and v4. Panoptic gives LPs new ways to interact with onchain options through an interactive interface layered on Uniswap.

  

Panoptic's [gRHO platform](https://grho.panoptic.xyz/), the passive LP interface built for [Uniswap](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-awarded-uniswap-foundation-grant), offers users the opportunity to earn yield by lending single-sided tokens to other LPs who want to LP on leverage, paying a borrow cost in the process.​

  

For traders seeking to optimize their strategies, whether that is perps, LPing, or options, Panoptic provides an intuitive platform equipped with powerful tools.

## Base Incentives

Panoptic launched the [Panoptic Incentive Points (Pips) Program](https://app.panoptic.xyz/leaderboard), designed to engage traders of all experience levels and reward them for their contributions.
