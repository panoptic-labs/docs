# Rules

The competition revolves around acquiring tokens and trading perpetual options on the tokens. The goal is to acquire the most amount of December and Nutcracker tokens through fair means.

  

Traders are sorted by the highest geometric mean of their two token amounts, calculated as follows:

  

$\text{Score} = \sqrt{ \text{December Tokens} \times \text{Nutcracker Tokens} }$

  

Remember, no cheating! Only legitimate single accounts are eligible for prizes. Santa is watching! ðŸ˜‰

  

To ensure a fair and enjoyable competition for all, participants are expected to adhere to the following legitimate actions:

  

-   Claim: make the most of the daily opportunity to claim tokens from the faucet on the onboarding page.
    
-   Swap: swapping tokens in the [designated Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0x39030FAE8909cFf20Bf101fc3c18d2bEBBA2bFA7&chain=base&inputCurrency=0x0C9D9dAa3D79899B0a8f57EA35285C041e86a78F) is a valid strategy.
    
-   Deposit: deposit your assets onto Panopticâ€™s platform.
    
-   Trade: show your trading skills by trading perpetual options on the platform.
    

  

Note: only tokens deposited into Panoptic will count towards your score. Withdrawn funds will not be counted. You can view your score at any time by visiting the [leaderboard](http://beta.panoptic.xyz/leaderboard).


We will closely monitor activities and reserve the right to disqualify any accounts that acquire tokens through methods not specified above. Our goal is to ensure a fair and competitive environment for everyone involved.


The competition begins on December 19, 2023. The end of the competition will be announced on our [socials](https://linktr.ee/panopticxyz).
