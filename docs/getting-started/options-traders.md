# Options Traders

Options Traders can leverage Panoptic's full-featured platform. Users can buy and sell capital-efficient, multi-legged options strategies on any token at any strike price. 

## Why Trade Options on Panoptic?

Panoptic offers the full flexibility that options traders are familiar with, without sacrificing liquidity. Here is how Panoptic avoids restrictions pervasive in DeFi options:

- **Supports large sized trades**: Panoptic enables unlimited selling of options. When there are no buyers, sellers are still compensated through Uniswap trading fees. Perpetual options remove expiries to consolidate liquidity. Panoptic renders OTC options on longtail assets obsolete since Panoptic is oracle-free and enables immediate listing of any asset pair.
- **Keeps variety without losing liquidity**: Traders can sell options at any strike price without limitation. Traders can choose whether to buy or sell options, which strike to underwrite, what type of option to trade (put, call, or any multi-leg combination), with full capital efficiency.
- **Ability to define your risk exposure**: Liquidity provision in Panoptic is separate from options selling. Users can choose between passive provision (no delta risk) and active option selling (has delta risk). Options sellers are equipped with risk management tools on Panoptic such as P&L visualization, [health meters](/docs/product/liquidations#liquidations-and-buying-power-usage), and Greeks calculations.
- **Capital Efficient**: Panoptic implements dynamic [collateral requirements](/docs/product/collateral-and-buying-power#collateral-requirements), liquidity-based [spreads](/docs/product/spread), and [force exercises](/docs/product/force-exercise) in order to ensure funds are efficiently used.

## Key Features of Options Trading on Panoptic
1. **Any Token, Any Strike**: Trade options on any ERC-20 token or native asset at any strike price, powered by the permissionless nature of Panoptic and Uniswap.
2. **Multi-Leg Strategies**: Create [sophisticated strategies](/research/essential-options-strategies-to-know) like straddles, spreads, iron condors, jade lizards, and more in just one click.
