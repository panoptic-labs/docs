# Borrowers

Borrowing on Panoptic lets you tap into lender-supplied liquidity to **withdraw funds**, **loop positions**, or **trade options with leverage**. Rates adjust automatically based on pool utilization, so borrowing costs respond to real-time demand.

## Why Borrow on Panoptic?
- **Flexible Capital**: Borrow to access liquidity without selling your assets.
- **Leverage & Looping**: Borrow to increase exposure or build looping positions.
- **Options Trading**: Borrowing is integrated with option margin accounts on Panoptic
- **Transparent Rates**: Borrow rates rise and fall with utilization, aligning cost with supply and demand.

## How Borrowing Works
1. **Liquidity Comes From Lenders**: [Lenders](/docs/getting-started/passive-lp) deposit tokens into [vaults](/docs/getting-started/vaults#lending-vaults) or lending markets.
2. **Borrowing Increases Utilization**: When users borrow, pool utilization and interest rates increase.
3. **Interest Accrues Over Time**: Interest is accrued on a user’s net amount of borrowed funds and distributed to lenders.

## Getting Started
### 1. Choose a Market
Head to our [app](https://app.panoptic.xyz) and pick the token you want to borrow and the market you want to borrow from (e.g., ETH/USDC).

### 2. Add Collateral
Before borrowing, you’ll need to deposit collateral..
- More collateral enables more borrowing capacity.
- Your collateral also helps keep your positions solvent under price moves.

### 3. Borrow Funds
Enter the amount you want to borrow, review the current borrow rate, then confirm the transaction.

Borrowed funds can typically be used to:
- **Withdraw** (move borrowed tokens to your wallet)
- **Loop** (borrow → swap → deposit → borrow again)
- **Trade options on margin**

### 4. Monitor Health & Costs
After borrowing, keep an eye on:
- **Utilization & Interest Rate**: Rates change as the pool fills or empties.
- **Collateral Health**: If your position becomes undercollateralized, it may be eligible for liquidation.

### 5. Repay Anytime
You can repay partially or fully to reduce interest costs and improve your collateral health.
