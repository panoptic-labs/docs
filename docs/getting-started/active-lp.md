# Active Liquidity Providers (LPs)

If you're a liquidity provider (LP) looking to maximize your returns, mitigate risks, and unlock new earning opportunities, you’re in the right place. Panoptic empowers LPs with tools that transform your LP positions, making it easier to earn more while managing your risks.

## Why Choose Panoptic?
- **Higher Earnings**: By [migrating](/docs/product/migrate) to Panoptic, you can earn up to [3x more](/docs/product/spread) in fees compared to traditional LPing on Uniswap. Our innovative lending model allows you to generate additional yield on your LP tokens.
- **Enhanced Risk Management**: Manage and monitor your position with a visual dashboard (coming soon) that provides insights into profit, loss, and risk factors, helping you make informed decisions.
- **Flexible Strategies**: Whether you’re bullish, bearish, or prefer delta-neutral positions, Panoptic opens up a [range of strategies](/research/essential-options-strategies-to-know) to suit your style. With tools including the ability to [short LP positions](/blog/turning-impermanent-loss-into-gain#shorting-lp-tokens-for-impermanent-gain), you’re no longer limited impermanent loss risks of standard LPing.

## How Does It Work?
1. **Migrate Your LP Position**: To redeploy Uniswap positions to Panoptic, follow our [migration guide](/docs/product/migrate).
2. **Open a New Position**: If you'd like to create a new Uniswap position through Panoptic, head to our app (coming soon) to [open](/docs/product/opening-a-position) a position.
3. **Earn Additional Yield**: Once migrated, Panoptic allows you to [lend](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/turning-impermanent-loss-into-gain#increased-revenue-from-lending-lp-tokens) out your LP tokens to options buyers, generating additional income beyond Uniswap fees.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Use Panoptic’s tools to [track](/docs/product/position-management) your position’s profit, loss, and risk factors in real-time. Adjust or [close](/docs/product/closing-a-position) your positions as needed.
