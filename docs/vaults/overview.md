# Introduction

## Overview

Panoptic Vaults are a decentralized asset management protocol that allows for the creation of on-chain, structured financial products. 
At their core, these vaults are smart contract-based investment funds that specialize in executing automated strategies using **perpetual options**. 
This design allows anyone to gain passive exposure to complex trading strategies—like covered calls, protective puts, or delta-neutral positions—that would otherwise require deep expertise and constant, active management.

The architecture is built on a flexible and secure set of smart contracts that separates key duties. 
A **Vault Manager** is responsible for executing the strategy, while a **Curator** establishes the risk parameters and safety rails, creating a system of checks and balances. 
This modular framework allows for the permissionless creation of unique, manager-driven funds on top of the Panoptic protocol.

## Who Are Vaults For?

The protocol is designed to serve two distinct groups within the DeFi ecosystem: Depositors seeking yield and risk management, and Managers seeking to deploy their strategies.

#### **For Depositors (Investors, DAOs, & Treasuries)**

For those looking to put their capital to work, Panoptic Vaults offer a simple way to access sophisticated financial instruments.

* **Diversify & Earn Yield:** Depositors can access strategies that generate returns in various market conditions, moving beyond typical lending and liquidity-providing yields.
* **Automated Risk Management:** DAOs and large token holders can use vaults to hedge their treasury assets. For example, a vault running a protective put strategy can automatically shield a treasury from downside market volatility.
* **Passive Exposure:** Gain the benefits of complex options strategies without needing to be an expert. Simply deposit assets and let the automated vault do the work.

#### **For Vault Managers & Strategists**

For skilled traders and asset managers, the protocol provides the infrastructure to deploy strategies and attract capital in a permissionless environment.

* **Focus on Strategy:** Leverage a secure and audited contract framework to build your on-chain fund. Instead of building an entire protocol from scratch, you can focus on what you do best: developing and executing winning strategies.
* **Attract Capital:** Launch a vault to build a verifiable track record and attract capital from across the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Flexible Infrastructure:** The system is designed to be composable, allowing managers to create a wide range of strategies involving perpetual options and other on-chain protocols.
