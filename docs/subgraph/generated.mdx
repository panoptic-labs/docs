This section explains the Panoptic Subgraph - a comprehensive indexer which takes raw Uniswap and Panoptic data and transforms it into easy to analyze entities for developers. You can use it to access data related to Panoptic pools, accounts, positions, transactions, and more.

## Entities
A good entity to start with to get a birds-eye view of the protocol is the `PanopticPoolAccount`:
> <h4><a href="docs/subgraph/types/objects/panoptic-pool-account">PanopticPoolAccount</a></h4>
> Tracks Panoption & PLP activity (collateral withdrawals and deposits) for a given Account & PanopticPool the Account has interacted with.

Learn more about all the entities you can query <a href="/docs/category/entities">here</a>.

## Example queries
See some example queries <a href="/docs/subgraph-example-queries">here</a> (coming soon).
