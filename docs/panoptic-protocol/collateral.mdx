# Collateral
How does Panoptic calculate collateral requirements

## Collateral tracking

Panoptic uses a collateral tracking system that is similar to TradFi margin accounts.
While users can borrow and effectively control funds several times larger than the collateral they deposited, they cannot withdraw those funds from the Panoptic-Uniswap ecosystem.
All funds are always owned by the Panoptic protocol, but users will 1) collect any fee generated by selling an option and 2) receive any gain in capital that results from buying an option that becomes in-the-money.

### Depositing collateral
Users that interact with the Panoptic protocol for the first time will have to first deposit collateral before they are able to trade any option.
This is done by calling the `deposit(uint128 assets, address token)` function in `PanopticPool.sol`.

The `PanopticPool` smart contract will issues a receipt token (similar to Aave's `aToken` and Compound's `cToken`) which uses a shares model to track yield distribution.
The amount of shares received after depositing `uint128 assets` is computed using the `convertToShares(uint128 assets)` function from `ReceiptBase.sol`:

```solidity
uint256 shares =
    (uint256(assets) * totalSupply()) / totalBalance();
```

where `totalSupply()` returns the total amount of receipt token issued and `totalBalance()` returns the amount of token available to withdraw

```solidity
uint256 totalBalance() =
    underlyingToken.balanceOf(panopticPool) -  // total amount in the PanopticPool
    lockedFunds() + // amount of collected fees (protected)
    inAMM(); // amount moved from PanopticPool to UniswapV3Pool (available)
```

Here, the accumulator `lockedFunds()` tracks the amount of fees that have been collected up to that point. 
This amount does not count towards `totalBalance()` because it is reserved to pay the option sellers' premium.

The accumulator `inAMM()` tracks the amount of token that has been moved from the `PanopticPool` to the `UniswapV3Pool`.
This amount *does* count towards `totalBalance()` because it has not left the Panoptic-Uniswap ecosystem.

### Withdrawing collateral
When a user wants to withdraw their tokens out of the Panoptic pool, they have to call `withdraw(uint256 shares, address token, uint256[] calldata positionIdList)`.
Accumulated yields from the deposited collateral will be transferred pro-rata to the user according to the shares model, where:

```solidity
uint128 assets =
    (shares * totalBalance()) / totalSupply();
```
where `totalBalance()` and `totalSupply()` are computed as described in the [Deposit](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#deposit) section.

The third argument of the `withdraw()` function, `positionIdList`,  must be the list of all positions held by `msg.sender`.
The `positionIdList` will be used to compute the collateral requirement for the account, and will fail if the position will be margin called or underwater (ie. `collateralRequired / collateralBalance < 1`).


## Cross-collateralization

<!--In TradFi, most options on equities are collateralized using cash or investments with stable value.
This means that the maximum loss for a cash-secured put is limited -->

In Panoptic, every user must deposit collateral in the `PanopticPool` before they can mint long or short options.
Liquidity providers can simply deposit their collateral like they would do in a lending protocol, and collect yields every time a user mints an option.

### Single-collateral
Let's consider Alice and Bob, two traders who chose to deposite a single type of collateral: Alice deposits 4500 Dai as collateral, and Bob deposits 3ETH.
In this case, if the price is 1500 Dai, then both Alice and Bob would all have the same buying power, about 4500 Dai to sell puts and 3 ETH to sell calls.

The maximum loss for Alice when selling puts would be 4500 Dai, which would happen if the price of ETH goes to 0.
On the other hand, the maximum loss if she chooses to sell naked calls instead could potentially be infinite: the max loss is unbounded and continues to linearly increase as the price goes to $\infty$.

Similarly, the maximum loss for Bob when selling calls is 3 ETH (if the price of ETH goes to $\infty$) and could potentially be infinity of he chooses to sell naked puts instead (which happens if the price of ETH goes to zero).

### Cross-collateral
Since losses could potentially be infinite, we recommend that users deposit both collateral when trading both puts and calls.
For example, let's consider what happens if Charlie deposits 1500 Dai and 2 ETH the ETH-Dai Panoptic Pool when the price of ETH is 1500 Dai.
Their buying power on the put side is 4500 Dai and it is 3 ETH on the call side, which is the same as Alice's and Bob's from the example above.

The maximum loss for Charlie, however, will be constrained by the amount of collateral desposited.
Charlie's max loss for selling naked calls will be partially covered by their 2 ETH of collateral, and the max loss will increase more slowly than Alice's
Similarly, Charlie's max loss for selling puts will also partially covered by their 1500Dai of collateral.
In that case, Charlie's max loss will increase more slowly than Bobs's.

However, in all those scenarios, any change in price or accumulation of long premium could make Alice's, Bob's or Charlie's accounts insolvent and lead their account to be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations).
