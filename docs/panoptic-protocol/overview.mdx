# Panoptic Overview
A basic overview of the Panoptic Protocol.

## What are Options?

Options are one of the most traded instrument in traditional finance.
They can be used to [hedge](docs/trading/basic-concepts) a portfolio, [speculate](/docs/trading/perpetual-options) on the value of an asset, create [synthetic positions](docs/trading/multi-leg-strategies) in a capital-efficient manner, or as a way to create [defined-risk](docs/trading/risks) positions.

Options are an agreement between two parties to buy (or sell) an asset for a fixed price at a pre-determined time.
Hence, each option has a
- **Strike**: the agreed-upon price the asset has to be bought/sold
- **Expiry**: a time in the future when the transaction has to occur
- **Premium**: the value of the option, or how much does the buyer pays for the right to buy/sell the asset

(figure here)

The value of an option --called the premium-- used to be difficult to determine.
Following the development of Nobel-prize winning mathematical models by Black, Scholes, and Merton, an optimal price can be derived in a way that buyers _and_ sellers both agree on the option contract's price.


## How do Panoptic Options differ from traditional options?

Options in Panoptic, however, differ slightly from conventional options.

The Panoptic protocol uses Liquidity Provider (LP) positions in Uniswap v3 as a fundamental building block for trading long and short options.
Specifically, this means:

- Options are [perpetual and never expire](/docs/panoptic-protocol/overview#liquidity-providing-as-selling-options)
- Anybody can deploy an options market on any asset in a [permissionless manner](/docs/category/technical-specifications)
- Panoptic allows anyone to be a [liquidity provider](docs/panoptic-protocol/protocol-roles#liquidity-providers) to lend their capital to options traders 
- Options have [unique properties](/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties): width, new concept of moneyness, user-defined numeraire, etc.
- [Pricing](/docs/panoptic-protocol/premium) does not involved counterparties (like market makers) and is path-dependent
- There is no concept of [vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Vega), which means premium for open positions will be affected by volatility expansion
- Collateralization requirements and buying power reduction [respond](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) to market activity
- Commissions are paid [only once](/docs/panoptic-protocol/collateral#commissions--fees), when the position is created
- Users can [delegate funds](/docs/panoptic-protocol/delegation) to another account
- Distressed accounts will be [liquidated](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations) by external users
- Long positions that are far-the-money may be [forced exercised](/docs/panoptic-protocol/liquidations#forced-exercise) by external users

# Protocol Design

## Manipulation Protections
The objective of many flash-loan-based attacks is to manipulate the price of an asset or token balance in a smart contract by borrowing a large amount of funds (sometimes for free!).
Importantly, all funds must be returned in the same block for flash-loan attacks.

The Panoptic Protocol seeks to prevent pool manipulation attacks by prohibiting the withdrawal of funds from the same block in which they were deposited.
Similarly, when funds are delegated to an account, both the delegator and delegatee accounts are locked for that block.

## Computed quantities 
Several computed quantities are derived from the token balance in the Panoptic and Uniswap v3 pools.

### Total Balance
The `totalBalance()` value is the amount of tokens that
<ol>
<li>can be sold and moved to the Uniswap v3 pool, or</li>
<li>have already moved to the Uniswap v3 pool</li>
</ol>

This balance is computed using the total token balance inside the Panoptic pool (obtained via `IERC20(token0).balanceOf(panopticPool)`), the amount of tokens moved into the Uniswap v3 pool, and the amount of tokens collected.

This derived quantity is used to compute the collateral shares.

```solidity
>pp = IPanopticPool
>univ3pool = IUniswapV3Pool
>token0 = ERC20 interface of collateral token                                | token0.balanceOf(pp) =
                                                                          _--| amount of token0 owned
                                                                         /   | by the Panoptic Pool
    _----------------pp.totalBalance()---------------_                  /      
   /                                                  \                /
  |   _----pp.inAMM0()---_     _--------------token0.balanceOf(pp)---------------_       
  |  /                    \   /                        |  _---pp.collected0()--_  \
  | |  amount of token0    | |  amount of `free` token | /                      \  |
  | |  moved from Panoptic | |   that can be withdrawn ||   collected token0,    | |
  | |   to UniswapV3       | |   or used to sell       ||    reserved to be      | |
  | |                      | |   undercollateralized   | \    paid to sellers   /  |
  |  \                    /   \     options            |  ¯--------------------¯  /
  |   ¯------------------¯     ¯-----------------------+-------------------------¯  
   \                                                  /
    ¯------------------------------------------------¯          

```

The `pp.collected0()` is the amount of tokens that are reserved to be paid to the sellers. Recall that, when you buy an option in Panoptic, you remove a seller's liquidity from a Uniswap v3 pool.
When trading activity happens in the pool, fees accumulate that the sellers *would* have earned had the buyer not moved the liquidity out of the pool to Panoptic.
These fees are incidentally also what makes up the cost of the option for the buyer, and we cover that topic elsewhere. The point is that the Panoptic Pool manages and collects these to-be-paid tokens and stores in `pp.collected0()`.

If the buyer has more collateral than what they owe the seller (and more by some margin of course), they can use their remaining free capital to do whatever they want.
They can sell options, e.g., by deploying this capital as LPs into the Uniswap v3 pool. This is what `token0.balanceOf(pp) - pp.collected0()` represents.

### Pool Utilization
The pool utilization is a measure of the fraction of the `totalBalance()` which belongs to the Uniswap v3 pool.
This parameter is computed whenever a position is minted to set the collateralization ratio and commission rate of the position:

```solidity
poolUtilization = pp.inAMM0() / pp.totalBalance();
                = pp.inAMM0() / (pp.inAMM0() + `free` token0)
                = pp.inAMM0() / (pp.inAMM0() + token0.balanceOf(pp) - pp.collected0())   



-Example 1: poolUtilization = 50%  (targeted equilibrium) 
   _------pp.totalBalance()--+-------------------------_
  /                          |                          \   COMMISSION_RATE       = 20bps             
 |     pp.inAMM0() (inAMM0)  |     `free` token0 (fT0)   |  BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO  = 10%                 
  \                          |                          /   SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO = 20%
   ¯-------------------------+-------------------------¯

   

-Example 2: poolUtilization = 90% (favors buying)
   _------pp.totalBalance()---------------------+------_
  /                                             |       \   COMMISSION_RATE       = 20bps             
 |                    pp.inAMM0()               | fT0    |  BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO  = 5%                 
  \                                             |       /   SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO = 100%
   ¯--------------------------------------------+------¯



-Example 3: poolUtilization = 10% (favors selling)
   _-----+-----pp.totalBalance()-----------------------_
  /      |                                              \   COMMISSION_RATE       = 60bps             
 | inAMM0|            `free` token0                      |  BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO  = 10%                 
  \      |                                              /   SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO = 20%
   ¯-----+---------------------------------------------¯

```


## Commission and Collateral Requirements

The commission and the collateralization ratios are computed *after* all funds have moved in/out of the Panoptic pool.


### Commission Fees

The commission rate is computed from the pool utilization and is paid whenever an option is minted.
The value of the commission to be paid is the `notional value` of the options multiplied by the commission rate.

The comission is set to 20bps at $\geq50$% pool utilization and linearly increases to 60bps for pool utilizations $\leq10$%.

```solidity
COMMISSION_RATE
              ^
              |  max commission = 60bps
     60bps  _ |_____
              |    .¯¯---__
              |    .       ¯¯---__        min commission = 20bps
     20bps  _ |    .              ¯¯---____________________________
              |    .                   .                        .
              +----+-------------------+------------------------+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION 
                  10%                 50%                      100%

```


### Collateralization ratio (buying)

When buying an option, collateral is necessary in order to ensure that the buyer can pay the seller the cost of the option which starts at zero and can increase based on trading activity.
The collateralization ratio for buying an option is set at 10% for pool utilization $\leq50$% and decreases linearly to 5% at a utilization of $\geq90$%.  


```solidity

BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO
              ^
              |   max ratio = 10% 
        10% _ |_________________________

              |                        .       ¯¯---__          min ratio = 5%

              +------------------------+-------------------+----+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                      50%                 90%   100%
                                                                      
```
### Collateralization ratio (selling)

The collateralization ratio for selling an option is set at a fixed 20% for pool utilization less than 50% and increases to 100% at 90% or more.  

```solidity

SELL_COLLATERAL_RATIO
              ^                                            max ratio = 100%
       100% - |                                            _________
              |                                       __-¯¯.    .

              |  min ratio = 20%            __-¯¯          .    .
        20% _ |_________________________--¯¯               .    .

              +------------------------+-------------------+----+--->   POOL_UTILIZATION
                                    50%                   90%   100%
                                           
```

### Buying Power Requirement (buying)

The buying power requirement for buying an option is simply: `BPR = BUY_COLLATERAL_RATIO * NOTIONAL_VALUE + ACCUMULATED_LONG_PREMIUM`

### Buying Power Requirement (selling)

The buying power requirement (BPR) for selling an option is :

The buying power requirement of a call can exceed the notional value of the minted option. 
However, users can deposit the asset as collateral in order to mitigate those risks.
