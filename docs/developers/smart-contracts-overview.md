# Smart contracts overview
Panoptic is a protocol that facilitates the trading of [Panoptions](/docs/terms/panoption), which are perpetual options instruments with fixed gamma between two prices that operate on a [streaming premium model](/docs/product/streamia). Under the hood, this consists of two components:
1. A lending market for Uniswap liquidity chunks that allows option sellers (lenders) to earn a [multiplier](/docs/product/spread) on Uniswap fees paid by borrowers (option buyers) that utilize their liquidity.
2. An [undercollateralized](/docs/product/leverage), [commissions-based](/docs/panoptic-protocol/commission) token [lending protocol](/blog/bringing-passive-liquidity-to-uniswap) that gives option sellers flexibility in managing their positions â€” allowing them to modify their payoffs and LP on Uniswap with more capital efficiency.

## Architecture & Contracts (Panoptic V1.1)
Panoptic V1.1 is an upgrade to Panoptic V1 that introduces the ability to create options markets on Uniswap V4 pools. The upgrade adds support for native ETH and native token pools on other chains, as well as pools with hooks (expansions to Uniswap V4) with the permissions `beforeInitialize`, `afterInitialize`, `beforeDonate`, `afterDonate`, `beforeSwap`, `afterSwap`, `beforeSwapReturnDelta`, and `afterSwapReturnDelta`. Panoptic V1.1 still uses V3-style oracles (which can consist of a Uniswap V3 pool or a Uniswap V4 hook that exposes the same interface).
