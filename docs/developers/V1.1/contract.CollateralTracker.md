# CollateralTracker
[Git Source](https://github.com/panoptic-labs/panoptic-v1-core/blob/v1.1.x/contracts/CollateralTracker.sol)

**Inherits:**
[ERC20Minimal](/docs/developers/V1.0/tokens/abstract.ERC20Minimal), [Multicall](/docs/developers/V1.0/base/abstract.Multicall)

**Author:**
Axicon Labs Limited

Tracks collateral of users which is key to ensure the correct level of collateralization is achieved.
This is represented as an ERC20 share token. A Panoptic pool has 2 tokens, each issued by its own instance of a CollateralTracker.
All math within this contract pertains to a single token.

This contract uses the ERC4626 standard allowing the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using ERC20 inheritance) in exchange for underlying "assets".
Panoptic uses a collateral tracking system that is similar to TradFi margin accounts. While users can borrow and
effectively control funds several times larger than the collateral they deposited, they cannot withdraw those funds
from the Panoptic-Uniswap ecosystem. All funds are always owned by the Panoptic protocol, but users will:

1) collect any fees generated by selling an option.

2) get any gain in capital that results from buying an option that becomes in-the-money.


## State Variables
### TICKER_PREFIX
Prefix for the token symbol (i.e. poUSDC).


```solidity
string internal constant TICKER_PREFIX = "po";
```


### NAME_PREFIX
Prefix for the token name (i.e POPT-V1.1 USDC LP on ETH/USDC 30bps).


```solidity
string internal constant NAME_PREFIX = "POPT-V1.1";
```


### DECIMALS
Decimals for computation (1 bps (basis point) precision: 0.01%).

*uint type for composability with unsigned integer based mathematical operations.*


```solidity
uint256 internal constant DECIMALS = 10_000;
```


### DECIMALS_128
Decimals for computation (1 bps (basis point) precision: 0.01%).

*int type for composability with signed integer based mathematical operations.*


```solidity
int128 internal constant DECIMALS_128 = 10_000;
```


### COMMISSION_FEE
The commission fee, in basis points, collected from PLPs at option mint.

*In Panoptic, options never expire, commissions are only paid when a new position is minted.*

*We believe that this will eliminate the impact of the commission fee on the user's decision-making process when closing a position.*


```solidity
uint256 immutable COMMISSION_FEE;
```


### SELLER_COLLATERAL_RATIO
Required collateral ratios for buying, represented as percentage * 10_000.

*i.e 20% -> 0.2 * 10_000 = 2_000.*


```solidity
uint256 immutable SELLER_COLLATERAL_RATIO;
```


### BUYER_COLLATERAL_RATIO
Required collateral ratios for selling, represented as percentage * 10_000.

*i.e 10% -> 0.1 * 10_000 = 1_000.*


```solidity
uint256 immutable BUYER_COLLATERAL_RATIO;
```


### FORCE_EXERCISE_COST
Basal cost (in bps of notional) to force exercise a position that is barely far-the-money (out-of-range).


```solidity
int256 immutable FORCE_EXERCISE_COST;
```


### TARGET_POOL_UTIL
Target pool utilization below which buying+selling is optimal, represented as percentage * 10_000.

*i.e 50% -> 0.5 * 10_000 = 5_000.*


```solidity
uint256 immutable TARGET_POOL_UTIL;
```


### SATURATED_POOL_UTIL
Pool utilization above which selling is 100% collateral backed, represented as percentage * 10_000.

*i.e 90% -> 0.9 * 10_000 = 9_000.*


```solidity
uint256 immutable SATURATED_POOL_UTIL;
```


### ITM_SPREAD_FEE
Fee, in basis points, that is charged on the intrinsic value of ITM positions.


```solidity
uint256 immutable ITM_SPREAD_FEE;
```


### POOL_MANAGER_V4
The canonical Uniswap V4 Pool Manager address.


```solidity
IPoolManager internal immutable POOL_MANAGER_V4;
```


### s_poolAssets
Cached amount of assets accounted to be held by the Panoptic Pool — ignores donations, pending fee payouts, and other untracked balance changes.


```solidity
uint128 internal s_poolAssets;
```


### s_inAMM
Amount of assets moved from the Panoptic Pool to the AMM.


```solidity
uint128 internal s_inAMM;
```


### s_initialized
Boolean tracking whether this CollateralTracker has been initialized.


```solidity

### exerciseCost

Get the cost of exercising an option. Used during a forced exercise.

This one computes the cost of calling the forceExercise function on a position:
- The forceExercisor will have to *pay* the exercisee because their position will be closed "against their will"
- The cost must be larger when the position is close to being in-range, and should be minimal when it is far from being in range. eg. Exercising a (1000, 1050)
position will cost more if the price is 999 than if it is 100
- The cost is an exponentially decaying function of the distance between the position's strike and the current price
- The cost decreases by a factor of 2 for every "position's width"
- Note that the cost is the largest among all active legs, not the sum

Example exercise costs:
- 10% if the position is liquidated when the price is between 950 and 1000, or if it is between 1050 and 1100
- 5% if the price is between 900 and 950 or (1100, 1150)
- 2.5% if between (850, 900) or (1150, 1200)

### _getRequiredCollateralSingleLegPartner

ITM and out-of-range

Calculate the required amount of collateral for leg `index` for position `tokenId` accounting for its partner leg.

*If the two token long-types are different (one is a long, the other a short, e.g.) but the tokenTypes are the same, this is a spread.*

*A spread is a defined risk position which has a max loss given by difference between the long and short strikes.*

*If the two token long-types are the same but the tokenTypes are different (one is a call, the other a put, e.g.), this is a strangle -
a strangle benefits from enhanced capital efficiency because only one side can be ITM at any given time.*

*if the position is a spread, then the collateral requirement consists of two components:*

*1) The difference in notional value at both strikes: `abs(strikeLong - strikeShort)` or `abs(strikeShort - strikeLong)`*

*2) A spread term which is relevant for legs that have different widths (calendar spreads)*


```solidity
function _getRequiredCollateralSingleLegPartner(
    TokenId tokenId,
    uint256 index,
    uint128 positionSize,
    int24 atTick,
    int16 poolUtilization
) internal view returns (uint256 required);

### _computeStrangle

Calculate the required amount of collateral for a strangle leg.

*Strangle legs are evaluated at 2x capital efficiency at low pool utilizations.*

*A strangle can only have only one of its leg tested at the same time, so this reduces the total risk and collateral requirement.*

function _computeStrangle(TokenId tokenId, uint256 index, uint128 positionSize, int24 atTick, int16 poolUtilization)
