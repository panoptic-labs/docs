### Term explanation

Panoptions are perpetual, oracle-free, decentralized, options based on Uniswap V3. They take advange of the fact that providing liquidity in Uniswap V3 is akin to selling covered calls. Panoptic makes use of this observation to provide an environment for the decentralized exchange of these instruments by allowing users to "reshuffle" liquidity in Uniswap V3 pools in such a way that it behaves as buying/selling options.
