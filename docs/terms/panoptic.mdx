### Term explanation

Panoptions are perpetual, oracle-free, decentralized, options with fixed gamma between two prices, operating on a streaming premium model. They take advantage of the fact that providing liquidity in Uniswap V3 and V4 is akin to selling puts. Panoptic makes use of this observation to provide an environment for the decentralized exchange of these instruments by allowing users to "reshuffle" liquidity in Uniswap V3 and V4 pools in such a way that it behaves as buying/selling options.
