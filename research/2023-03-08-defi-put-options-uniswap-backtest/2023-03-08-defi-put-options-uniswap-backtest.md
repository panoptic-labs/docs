Imagine a market that only lets you sell assets, never buy...Could you be profitable?

That market isn't imaginary. That market is...Uniswap Liquidity Providing!

LPing = selling options, but what if users could SHORT LP tokens and effectively BUY options...?

<!--truncate-->

----------

### LP = Short Put
LP positions on Uni V3 mimic the payoff of selling put options. Uniswap users can only deposit liquidity and sell put options, which means they can only take a bullish position.

-   Token goes up, LP value goes up (but capped) 🚀
    
-   Token goes down, LP value goes down 😭

While selling options can be profitable, our backtests show that it wasn't always the case 👇

Is there a way to "short" an LP position and effectively *buy* a put option...?

We'll answer this... But first, let's simulate an options buying strategy!

----------
### Backtest Strategy
For this study:

-   🗓️ Jun 2021 - Jan 2023 (20 months) where applicable
    
-   ⚖️ Daily rebalancing
    
-   📏 Narrow (r = 1.05) range ↔️ 0DTE
    

Daily strategy:

1.  Buy ATM put option by shorting LP position
    
2.  Exercise/close put option at end of day
    
3.  Pay LP swap fees as streamia (streaming premium)
    
### ETH Puts
Returns on buying ETH put options:

-   🌕 ETH-USDC (5bps): 112%
    
-   🚀 ETH-USDC (30bps): 85%
    
-   🧑‍🚀 ETH-USDC (100bps): 57%

(Returns in USDC)

👉Put option returns are exactly opposite of LP returns👈

### L1/Utility Token Puts
Buying "L1/Utility token" put options:

-   🤩 BTT (+67%)
    
-   😍 GNO (+40%)
    
-   😊 $WBTC (+12%)
    
-   😦 MATIC (-47%)
    
-   😢 LINK (-86%)
    
-   😭 ENS (-101%)

(Returns in ETH, see legend 👇 for pool details)

### DeFi Token Puts
Buying "DeFi token" put options:

-   😎 1INCH (+74%)
    
-   🙂 AAVE (+10%)
    
-   🙂 UNI (+10%)
    
-   😕 MKR (-1%)

(Returns in ETH)

👉DeFi puts did pretty good!👈

### NFT/Meme Token Puts
Buying "NFT/Meme token" put options:

-   😶 LOOKS (-9%)
    
-   😬 APE (-42%)
    
-   😳 HEX (-52%)
    
(Returns in ETH)

👉Don't "put" ⤵️ down the meme tokens👈


### Summary
Key Insights:

-   🐻 Bearish price action = high payoff
    
-   💰 Payoff > streamia → profit!
    
![img-7](./img-7.png)

In TradFi, options buying is more profitable when Implied Volatility (IV) < Realized Volatility (RV). Do we see the same result here?

Instead of IV let's use the streamia:

-   Easier to calculate 🧮
    
-   ⬆️ IV ⇔ ⬆️ Streamia
    
![img-8](./img-8.png)

Graph above:

-   🐶 Outperforming puts (green dots): lie above the line, low streamia given volatility ("IV < RV")
    
-   😈 Underperforming puts (pink dots): lie below the line, too expensive ("IV > RV")
    

Is there a way to "short" an LP position and, hence, *buy* a put option?

Enter Panoptic! Panoptic allows you to buy *and* sell DeFi options for any crypto asset, any strike, any size.

Caveats:

-   ⛽ Ignores gas/spread/swap fees/commission
    
-   💲 Assumes put option streamia = LP collected fees
    
-   ❓ This is a "what if" scenario — you can't buy put options on Uniswap (yet)
    

Question:

-   ⚖️ Are LP returns in disequilibrium?
