HODL vs. LP vs. Calls — which one's best?

-   ⬇️❗HODL downside is substantial (can go to 0)
    
-   🧢 LP upside is capped on Uni V3 — token goes up, you now hold the other token
    
-   🚫🧢 Call options have unlimited upside, capped downside — but pay streamia (streaming premium)

### Backtest Strategy

Let's backtest *hypothetical* DeFi call options (wen Panoptic? 😉)

🗓️ Jun '21 - Feb '23

⚖️ Periodic rebalancing (day, week, or month)

Strategy:

-   Buy at-the-money (ATM) call option
    
-   Exercise/close at end of period
    
-   Pay LP fees as streamia
    

Note: Here’s [how Panoptic creates a call option](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/panoptic-protocol/option-properties#creating-a-call-option)

### Return breakdown on ETH daily call options 📞

-   Payoff: 519%
    
-   Streamia: 397%
    
-   Profit: 122%

(All values are USDC)

👉Payoff > Streamia → Profit🔝🤑📈

That's pretty good! How does it compare to other rebalancing periods?👇

### Dailies vs Weeklies vs Monthlies

- 🌕 ETH Dailies: 122%

- 🧑‍🚀 ETH Weeklies: 11%

- 🚀 ETH Monthlies: 28%

👉Active management for the win!👈 (Keep in mind this doesn't account for gas fees⛽ — future #ResearchBites 😉)

Good returns, but can calls survive a bear market?

### Bull vs. Bear Market

-   🐂 Bull Market: June '21 - April '22
    
    -   👉 Compare w/ ETH HODL return: 0.8%
        
-   🐻 Bear Market: May '22 - Feb '22
    
    -   👉 Compare w/ ETH HODL return: -41%

Not only did call options survive a bear market, they blew HODL out of the water 💎🙌🙅🏻‍♂️🌊💨

What if you had chosen another fee-tier?

### Different Fee Tiers

-   🌕 ETH-USDC 5bps: 122%
    
-   🚀 ETH-USDC 30bps: 95%
    
-   🧑‍🚀 ETH-USDC 100bps: 66%
    

![img-5](./img-5.png)

👉The 5 bps pool outperformed, here's why👇

### Here's how different fee-tier pools breakdown

-   🧾 The 5 bps pool had the least trading fees (streamia)
    
-   🚀 The 5 bps pool had the most upward price action
    
![img-6](./img-6.png)

👉 That's why the 5 bps pool was the most profitable!👈

### Summary
Key Insights:

-   💎🙌 Calls > HODL b/c capped downside
    
-   🌊 Calls > LP (we tested this last time👇)
    
-   🐂🐻 Bull markets are best for calls, bear markets were OK
    
-   🚀 Bullish price action = high payoff
    
-   💰 Payoff > streamia → profit!

Caveats:

-   ⛽ Ignores gas/spread/swap fees/commission
    
-   💲 Assumes put option streamia = LP collected fees
    
-   ❓ This is hypothetical — you can't buy call options on Uniswap (Panoptic soon 🤫)
